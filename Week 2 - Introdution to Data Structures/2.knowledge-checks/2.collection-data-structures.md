1. Question 1 You wish to store a list of grades for a class. Given the choice between a set and a list, which is the more appropriate data structure? 
 - List
 - Either would do
 - Set
  ```
  answer: List
  Correct Correct. A list will allow you to store repeating instances of data.
  ```
2. Question 2 In relation to data structures what does mutability mean?   
 - It means that once an object is created it cannot be changed.   
 - It relates to dynamic programming languages, and it can be passed as a variable to a function.  
 - It means that it can be changed after it has been created.  
  ```
  answer: It means that it can be changed after it has been created.
  Correct That’s correct. It relates to the ability to be able to change a value after it has been instantiated.

3. Question 3 LIFO and FILO mean the same thing?    
 - True   
 - False   
 ```
 answer: True
 Correct That’s correct. FILO (First In Last Out) is another way of saying LIFO (Last in First Out).
 ```
4. Question 4 Creating a class through the use of a capital T as below:  Stack<T>, is an example of what?
 - Generics
 - Immutability
 - Encapsulation
  ```
  answer: Generics
  Correct That’s correct. In this way, the object created from the class need not be confined to one specific type until compile time.
  ```
5. Question 5 On what type of data structure would one do a depth first search?    
 - Stacks  
 - Trees   
 - Lists  
```
  Correct That's correct. A tree is a series of interconnected nodes that build under one root node. Doing a depth first search, is to follow one branch of nodes to the very deepest one.
