1. Question 1 What does it mean to say a Data Structure is a first-class object?   
 - It is very quick at retrieving and storing data.   
 - This means that a data structure can be passed to a function, returned as a result and generally treated like any other variable.   
 - They are not memory intensive.   
 
 ```
 answer: This means that a data structure can be passed to a function, returned as a result and generally treated like any other variable
 Correct That’s correct. It relates to the capabilities available to it.
 ```
2. Question 2 What does it mean to parse a string?    
 - To pass it to the compiler to execute instructions.   
 - To remove symbols and uppercases from a string of text.  
 - To remove items from a string not based on a given format.  
  ```
  answer: To remove items from a string not based on a given format
  Correct That’s correct. This format can be anything such as the shape of the date, or a repeating pattern such as name, date of birth, address, etc.
  ```
3. Question 3 How many bytes does it normally take to represent a standard int?    
 - 16   
 - 8  
 - 4  
 ``` 
 Correct That’s correct. A standard int takes 4 bytes.
 ```   
4. Question 4 A Boolean answer is one that will be either true or false?      
 - True  
 - False  
 ```
 Correct That’s correct. Depending on the language it might be 0 or 1, this is just a different representation of true or false.
 ```   
5. Question 5 Is it possible to copy an array?    
 - Yes, but only through making a shallow-copy.  
 - Yes, but only through making a deep-copy.  
 - No.  
 ```
 answer: Yes, but only through making a deep-copy.
 Correct Correct. While one can make a shallow copy of an array, the actual array itself is not copied. Making a deep copy creates a new instance of an array with the same values but that exists in its own space in memory.
