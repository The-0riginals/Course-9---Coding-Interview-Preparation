1. Question 1 What do TSV files use to separate their data?   
 - Topic   
 - Tabs   
 - Types
 ```
 answer: Tabs
 Correct That’s correct. The TSV are Tab Separated Values.
  CSV (Comma-Separated Values) 
 ```
2. Question 2 Arrays are always stored on the stack? 
 - No  
 - Yes, but only through making a shallow-copy.   
 - Yes, but only through making a deep-copy. 
 ```
 answer: No
 Correct That’s correct. Arrays are stored on the heap.
 ```
3. Question 3 What happens when you try to retrieve a value using a number greater than the index size?      
 - It would throw an error.   
 - Nothing. There would be nothing to retrieve so it would return null.  
 - It would return a warning and a message indicating the issue.  
 ```
 answer: It would throw an error.
 Correct That’s correct. Accessing the array outside of the index range throws an out-of-bounds error.
 ```   
4. Question 4 In relation to computer science, what is a class?         
 - It is a blueprint for an object.  
 - An object that has functionality.   
 - It is the thing from which arrays are build. 
 ```
 answer: It is a blueprint for an object.
  Correct That’s correct. How the class is coded is what characteristics the object will embody.
 ```
5. Question 5 In relation to objects, what are instance variables?     
 - Characteristics of the class.  
 - Attributes that can take on many forms.  
 - An attribute that has an immediate impact when compiled.  
  ```
  answer: Characteristics of the class.
  Correct That’s correct. Variables are the characteristics or attributes associated with a class.
  ```   
6. Question 6 How many children can a node in a binary tree have?   
 - 2  
 - 4   
 - 1  
 ```
 answer: 2
 Correct That’s correct. As the name suggests it can have two children nodes, one larger and one smaller.
 ```   
7. Question 7 Which of the following uses a FIFO approach.    
 - Lists  
 - Queues   
 - Stacks 
  ```
  answer: Queues
  Correct That's correct! A queue works much like its namesake. The first one to arrive is the first one to be served.
  ```   
8. Question 8 In relation to data structures what does synchronization mean?    
 - It is something to do with swimming.
 - Making a class thread safe.
 - Relates to a measured way of increasing the size of an object. 
 ```
 answer: Making a class thread safe.
 Correct That’s correct. Synchronizing an object means that only one thing can access it at a time.
 ```
9. Question 9 Why do you need to implement a comparator when storing objects on a tree?      
 - To ensure that values don’t clash when being added to a tree. 
 - So that the compiler can know to keep the tree balanced by comparing a number of nodes.    
 - As a means of comparing objects so the tree knows which node to store an object on. 
 ```
 answer: As a means of comparing objects so the tree knows which node to store an object on.
 Correct That’s correct. The implementation of some trees requires that objects are stored relative to one another. Enabling a comparator allows you store objects of different types in relation to one another.
 ```   
10. Question 10 Why are heaps called heaps?     
 - The organization of their data is done in a very loose way, so it is said that the elements are heaped together.   
 - The order of importance is determined by where in the data structure the information is found.   
 - Because they store a selection of different data types.  
  ```
  answer:The order of importance is determined by where in the data structure the information is found.
  Correct Correct. A heap will place the most important element at the top. This can be the highest or lowest depending on implementation. The design of this approach is that one would only take the top value and not try and retrieve one in the middle.
