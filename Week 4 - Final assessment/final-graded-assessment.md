1. Question 1 Where would you most likely to be asked a series of coding related questions?
 - During the screening.
 - During the take-home assignment.
 - Your technical interview.
 ```
 answer: Your technical interview.
 Correct That's correct! A technical interview will be most concerned with coding related attributes.
 ```
2. Question 2 How do computers store and represent information?  
 - HTML  
 - Java   
 - Binary   
 ```
 answer: Binary
 Correct That's correct! Computers use binary as a way of storing and representing information
 ```  
3. Question 3 If an application returned a result after one computation it ran in:   
 - O(n)    
 - O(log(n))  
 - O(1)   
 ```
 Correct That's correct. This means that it returns after the first check.
 ```   
4. Question 4 Space complexity is more concerned with:  '
 - Time
 - Space
 - Continuum
 ```
 Answer: Space
 Correct That's correct! It is a metric that establishes the space a program takes.
 ```
5. Question 5 Which of the following are linear structures?  
  - Trees  
  - Graphs  
  - Arrays  Correct That's correct. Arrays store information in a linear structure.   
6. Question 6 Which of the following statements is true?  
 - LinkedLists can grow without having to copy their values when expanding.    
 - Array based lists can grow without having to copy their values when expanding.   
 - An array-based approach is the only way of creating a list.    
 ```
 Answer: LinkedLists can grow without having to copy their values when expanding.
 Correct That's correct. LinkedLists keep a record of nodes through pointers rather than in contiguous spaces in memory.
 ```   
7. Question 7 What is in-place swapping?  
 - Swapping items in an array in place of creating a new structure.  
 - Using different types of data structures as a container to emulate certain characteristics.  
 - Moving values in an array if the element being added is smaller.   
 ```
 Answer: Swapping items in an array in place of creating a new structure.
 Correct That's correct! This saves space by not having to create new variables. 
 ```  
8. Question 8 Which of the following are actual data structures?   
 - C Trees  
 - A Trees  
 - B Trees  
 ```
 Answer: B Trees
 Correct That's correct! The meaning of the B is not known but some suggestions are balanced, boeing or binary.
 ```
9. Question 9 What are collection classes? 
 - Classes that are used by data structures to give them extra functionality like sorting.    
 - Specialized classes for data storage and retrieval.   
 - Collections that take a specific type of class.  
 ```
 Answer: Specialized classes for data storage and retrieval.
 Correct That's correct! They reflect a suite of data structures that act in unique ways and as such can be more suited to a given problem.
 ```  
10. Question 10 True or false: Dynamic programming is about using dynamic structures when coding.  
 - True   
 - False   
 ```
 Answer: False
 Correct That's correct is relates more to the approached used when coding over the type of structures used.
 dynamic structures are those that can grow(expand) and shrink as needed.
