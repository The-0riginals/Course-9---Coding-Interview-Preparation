1. Question 1 Given an array of 6 numbers `-> 6, 8, 19, 48, 9, 90` and applying a selection sort.  How many swaps must occur before the array is sorted? 
 - 2   
 - 6  
 - 4  
 ```
 ans: 2
 Correct That's correct. The array is mostly ordered so only have to swap 19 and 9; and then 48 and 19.
 ```   
2. Question 2 Given an array of numbers and a target value, using a loop, what is the worst-case time complexity to check if the number is present in the array?  
 - O(n)  
 - O(log n)  
 - O(1)  
 ```
 Ans: O(n)
 Correct That’s correct. To determine if a value was there, using a loop would mean checking every element in the array.
 ```   
3. Question 3 A binary search can only be performed on a sorted dataset.   
 - True  
 - False   
 ```
 Ans: True
 Correct That’s correct. The nature of binary search is that it checks if the value is higher or lower and removes everything beyond the point of that conditional statement.
 ```   
4. Question 4 Given the following snippet of pseudocode: 
```
 array = [] 
 n = 4   
 FOR i = 0 TO n:     
    FOR j = 0 TO n:        
        array.add(i*j)  

```
 What is the space complexity of this problem? 
  - O(n^2)  
  - O(log n)  
  - O(n)  
  ```
  Correct That’s correct. As n is looped through twice, the number of computations will reflect n*n or n^2.
  ```
5. Question 5 What advantage is there to changing element location using an in-place swap?  
 - It is a memory feature that allows many variables to reference the same memory location.   
 - It reduces the time taken to complete an algorithm through lowering the time complexity.   '
 - It reduces the amount of space taken by removing the need to create another variable in memory.   
 ```
 Ans: It reduces the amount of space taken by removing the need to create another variable in memory.
 Correct That's correct. In-place swapping is done to arrays in place of creating new ones and storing the sorted data there. It is a good process for reducing the space complexity of a solution.
