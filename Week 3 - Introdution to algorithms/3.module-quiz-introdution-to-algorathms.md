1. Question 1 Insertion sort is an example of divide and conquer?    -
 - True   
 - False  
 ```
 ans: False
 Correct That's correct. Insertion sort processes each element in relation to its surrounding elements until the data is eventually sorted.
 ```   
2. Question 2 Given an array of 6 numbers `[6,8,19,48,9,90]`and applying insertion sort, how many swaps must occur before the array is sorted?   
 - 2   
 - 4  
 - 6  
 ```
 ans: 2
 Correct That's correct. The array is mostly ordered so only have to swap 9 twice, first with 48, then with 19.
 ```   
3. Question 3 What time complexity is required to do a linear search?   '
 - (log (n)) 
 - O(n)  
 - O(1)  
 ```
 ans: O(n)
 Correct That’s correct. A linear search requires that you do a search of every item. So it will take n (the number of items) time to search.
 ```   
4. Question 4 Why do we need Big-O notation to evaluate our programs?     
 - Because measuring time is relative to a person’s computer, so a relative metric is required.   
 - Because sorting is complicated, and we need a complicated metric.   
 - Because sorting requires that things are moved around to save space.  
  ```
  ans: Because measuring time is relative to a person’s computer, so a relative metric is required.
  Correct That’s correct. A relative metric is required to measure time.  
  ```
5. Question 5 What is parallelization?   
  - It is about running code at the same time in threads or on separate computers.   
  - It is about calling functions repetitively until they have achieved a base case.   
  - It is about writing your code in one go.   
  ```
  ans: It is about running code at the same time in threads or on separate computers.
  Correct That’s correct. You have successfully identified a brief definition of parallelization.
  ```  
6. Question 6 Why would you decide to use recursion?   
 - It looks cool and makes your code seem more intelligent.  
 - It lends itself well to a divide and conquer approach. 
 - Recursion reduces the pressure on the compiler by making less stack calls.   
 ```
 ans: It lends itself well to a divide and conquer approach.
 Correct That's correct. Recursion works well with the divide and conquer approach. 
 ```
7. Question 7 Why does Memoization work well with dynamic programming?     
 -  It requires less compiling because it stores previous results, reducing the load on the CPU.   
 - Because it takes a lot of memory to run some programs and memoization allows you to store data in smaller sizes.    
 - It takes up less space in the hard drive.   
 ```
 ans: It requires less compiling because it stores previous results, reducing the load on the CPU.
 Correct That’s correct. Dynamic programming utilizes memoization because it stores the results of computations, meaning the computations don’t have to be repeated.
 ```  
8. Question 8 How are the principles of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms at odds with one another?     
 - The greedy algorithm will use up CPU by monopolizing resources.  
 - Because dynamic programming will react with more agility to a program, while the greedy approach will be slower and more self-centered.   
 - The principle of dynamic programming is to exhaustively compute the best solution, while a greedy approach will favor take the immediate best option.  
```
 ans: The principle of dynamic programming is to exhaustively compute the best solution, while a greedy approach will favor take the immediate best option.
 Correct That’s correct. With dynamic programming, you can find the most best solution, whereas greedy algorithms have a specific process.
```  
9. Question 9 Why is a binary search conducted in O(log n) time?   
 -  It is not, it is conducted in O(n).   
 - Because as it searches it sorts the elements.  
 - Regardless of the size of the input, at every step the number of calculations is halved.  
 ```
 ans: Regardless of the size of the input, at every step the number of calculations is halved.
 Correct That’s correct. Log n means that it is not instantaneous access but it rapidly reduces the lookup space.
 ```   
10. Question 10   In the Fibonacci pseudocode above how many recursive instances can be seen?     
```
def fibonanci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    else:
     return fibonanci(n-1) + fibonanci(n-2)

```
 - 0  
 - 1  
 - 2   
 ```
 ans: 2
 Correct That’s correct. The algorithm is being called on the last, and second to last number on the series.
