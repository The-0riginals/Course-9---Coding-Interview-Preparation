1. Question 1 What should be done when presented with a technical problem where the solution is not immediately obvious?  
 - Information:The option to copy question text is disabled on assessments.  
 - Ask the interviewer how they would solve the problem.   
 - Move the conversation along and try not to draw attention.    
 - Ask questions.  
 ```
 answer: Ask questions.
 Correct That’s correct. It can be that the question was posed in a way you were unfamiliar with, or discussing the problem might give you some clarity.
 ```    
2. Question 2 During a technical interview, is it better to rely on the work of others, or code everything yourself?  

 - Write as much code as you can to show off your skills.   
 - Use the data structures, but don’t use any other external implementation.   
 - Use code written by others.  
 ```
 ans: Use code written by others
 Correct That’s correct. It is important to show that you can use the tools available to you. It is not necessary to reinvent the wheel.

3. Question 3 Given an array that represents sock colors: 
 `Sock_colors = [3,3,2,1,1,3,5,1,4,2]`, how many pairs of the same color socks exist? 
 - 2  
 - 3  
 - 4 
  ```
  answer: 3
  Correct That's correct. Socks 1, 3, 4, and 5 are odd.
  ```   
4. Question 4 It is best to remain silent when writing code during a technical interview. 
 - True  
 - False  
 ```
 answer: False
 Correct That's correct. The interviewer is there to assess your ability in a short space of time. You may not get a chance to implement all of your ideas. Drawing rough solutions on a whiteboard and explaining your thought process can give them insights into how you think.
 ```  
5. Question 5 Should I ask questions in an interview? 
 - Yes. Ask questions for clarity or during an appropriate time.  
 - Yes, but only when the conversation looks like it is going to help the interviewer along.  
 - Yes. Asking questions can run down the interview clock and so avoid awkward questions.   
 ```
 answer: Yes. Ask questions for clarity or during an appropriate time.
 Correct Correct. It is natural that you will have questions about the company that you may be working for. However you will be given time at the end to find this information out. Though you may be unsure of a question directed at you and want some clarity. In this instance it is also a good idea to ask questions.
 ```  
6. Question 6 What is the STAR method? 
 - A coding practice with 4 key components.  
 - A stellar answer to a good question.  
 - A structured approach to answering questions.   
  ```
  answer: A structured approach to answering questions.
  Correct That’s correct. The STAR methods refers to (Situation, Task, Action, Result), it is away of structuring answers in an interview that will give the interview some good scope into your thought process.
  ```  
7. Question 7 What is meant by transfer rate in relation to a CPU?
 - The rate at which instructions are processed.  
 - The rate at which a processor can convert input from a terminal.   
 - The rate at which memory is transferred into cache. 
  ```
  answer: The rate at which memory is transferred into cache.
  Correct That’s correct. CPU processes cache memory. The transfer rate refers to how fast information can be transferred from memory into cache.
  ```  
8. Question 8 When engaged with a coding interview what sorts of tests should you aim to include?
 - Integration tests  
 - Functional tests  
 - Unit tests  
 ```
 answer: Unit tests
 Correct That’s correct. All testing is important, but you will only have so much time in an interview. Unit tests are simple tests that are easily implemented and will demonstrate your propensity to test while still leaving you time to complete a workable solution
 ```
9. Question 9 Which memory location is closest to the CPU?  
 - Cache  
 - Main memory  
 - Secondary memory  
 ```'
 answer: Cache
 Correct That’s correct. A cache is located closest to the CPU so has the quickest access.'
 ```   
10. Question 10 When designing a solution it is best to:  
 - Planning an outline, engaging the main obstacles, looking at the potential solutions and constantly reviewing.  
 - Tackle every problem as it arises.  
 - Doing a quick sketch then implementing everything on the page.  
  ```
  answer: Planning an outline, engaging the main obstacles, looking at the potential solutions and constantly reviewing.
  Correct That’s correct. Planning is important and will need to be revised when new aspects of the project are met over the course of implementing it.
