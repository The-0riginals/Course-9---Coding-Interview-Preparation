1. Question 1 Which has the largest time to compute?  1 / 1 point 
 - O(1)    
 - O(log n)   
 - O(N)   
 ```
 answer: O(N)
 O(N) is the largest time to compute.
 ```
2. Question 2 Given the following lines of code pseudocode;   
```
N = 7   
FOR i = 1 TO N:        
output(i) 
```
 - O(N)    
 - O(n^2)   
 - O(1)   
 ```
 answer: O(N)
 As the loop is set to the size of N, when N increases so does the time complexity.
 ```
3. Question 3 Given the following lines of code pseudocode;   
``` 
N = 7   
FOR i = 1 TO N:        
    FOR j = 1 TO N:          
       output(N)  1 / 1 point 
```
 - O(n^2)   
 - O(N)    
 - O(1)   
 ```
 answer: O(n^2)
 There are 2 loops so every time the application runs, it must do N*N executions.
 ```
4. Question 4 Given the following lines of code pseudocode:  
``` 
N = 37   
 FOR i = 1 TO N:    
     WHILE i < 10:      
          output(i*N) 
```
 - O(n^2)   
 - O(1)    
 - O(N)   
 ```
 answer: O(N)
 The inner loop is only run a finite number of times that does not increase with N.
 ```
5. Question 5 Given the following lines of code pseudocode;  
``` 
N = 37   
 FOR i = 1 TO N:     
      WHILE i < 10:        
              output(i*N)
``` 
 - O(1)    
 - O(n^2)   
 - O(N)   
 ```
 answer: O(n)
 The inner loop is only run a finite number of times that does not increase with N.
 ```
6. Question 6 Given the following lines of code pseudocode:  
``` 
N = 10   
 FOR i = 1 TO 5:     
      FOR j = 1 TO i:        
                output(i*j)
```  
 - O(Log N)    
 - O(1)    
 - O(n^2)  
```
answer: O(1)
The execution of the code is not dependent on N so it will not use log when computing the complexity.
=>> As I is limited to 5. Regardless of how large the input becomes it will always be limited to the number of executions. 
```
7. Question 7  Given the following lines of code pseudocode:    output(N)     
```
N = 7
 FOR i = 1 TO N:       
       FOR j = 1 TO N:        
           output(N)
 ```
 - O(1)     
 - O(N)    
 - O(n^2)  
 ```
 answer: O(n^2)
 There are 2 loops so every time the application runs, it must do N*N executions.
