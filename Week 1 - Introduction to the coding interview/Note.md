__optimizing your code:__
- To optimize space complexity, you may opt for a solution that does in-place changes over creating a new data structure to house the result
- Avoid excessive compiler calls. If you are searching for a value in an array, terminate the loop when the item is found. 
- Modularize this code into a function that is callable repeatedly and reuse the code when possible.
- If there are portions of your code that are no longer required as a result of modularizing, or as a result of an avenue of thought that was not completed, remove it
